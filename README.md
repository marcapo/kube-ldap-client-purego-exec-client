# kube-ldap-client-purego-exec-plugin

This is a Go rewrite of <https://github.com/gyselroth/kube-ldap-client-go-exec-plugin>.
The former uses the nexec npm package to create a standalone binary, but nexec hasn't had a new release since 2017 and support for platforms like ARM Linux or M1 Macs is unclear.
